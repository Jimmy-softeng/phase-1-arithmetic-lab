// Write your code here
// Create a variable called multiply and set it to an equation that multiplies num1 and num2 to get 62
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;  // 31 * 2 = 62

// Create a variable called random that generates a random integer greater than 0
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;  // Generates a random integer between 1 and 100

// Create a variable called mod and set it to an equation that calculates the remainder of num3 divided by num4 to get 4
let num3 = 18;
let num4 = 7;
let mod = num3 % num4;  // 18 % 7 = 4

// Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set, and the value returned should be 20
let max = Math.max(10, 15, 20, 5, 8);  // Finds the highest number in the set (10, 15, 20, 5, 8)
console.log(max);  // Outputs: 20
